A simple game that I played in a dream.  To my surprise, upon waking I found it
to not require changing fundamental properties of the universe.

# Gameplay

The game board is a ragged grid of blocks; columns may contain any number of
blocks in them, but the blocks are always weighted towards the top.  The player
character moves across adjacent blocks (not diagonals).  If any block is
visited twice, the game is over.

The board scrolls off the screen at a constant (or slowly increasing) rate.  If
any block is unvisited when it scrolls off the edge, the game is over.

Score is the number of blocks visited.
